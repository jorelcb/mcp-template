# Contributing to mcp-template

This template serves as the base for new MCP servers. Changes here should be generic and applicable to *all* future servers.

## Workflow

1.  **Fork** and **Clone**.
2.  Create a branch.
3.  Make improvements to the scaffolding (e.g., better build scripts, updated dependencies).
4.  **Pull Request**.

## Guidelines

- Keep the template minimal.
- Ensure `extension.yaml` and `GEMINI.md` standard files are present.
- Verify `npm install` works with a fresh clone.
